# auto-repair vehicle
simple vehicle auto repair shop application that saves data on a .txt file using c++
you just have to put the coba.cpp and all of the .txt files at the same folder location and simply run the coba.cpp code

made this for my algorithm and programming class final exam in college, first time using C++ and implemented some kind of CRUD using C++. i know that the code has many flaws but i guess this is pretty good for a first time experience haha
